## About
A trivial Rust program that runs an HTTP server and can shut down or put your PC to sleep when it receives a corresponding request. Can be used, for instance, to put your PC to sleep from a mobile phone when you're too lazy to get up from your coach.

The program runs on port 13666. Supported methods:
* /sleep - puts your PC to sleep
* /shutdown - shuts your PC down
* /stop - stops the server
