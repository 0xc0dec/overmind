## About
A trivial C++ program that runs an HTTP server and puts your PC to sleep once it receives a GET /sleep request. Can be used, for instance, to put your PC to sleep from a mobile phone when you're too lazy to get up from your coach.

The program runs on port 13666. Supported methods:
* /sleep - puts your PC to sleep
* /stop - stops the server
